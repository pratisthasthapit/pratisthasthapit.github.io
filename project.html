          Creating beautiful websites is my passion!
          <br><br>
          The projects I have worked on are mostly website and web and
          mobile apps development using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and Java. My
          projects feature responsiveness, easy to navigate UI and dynamic design.
          I enjoy creating websites which are well-designed, interactive and engaging.
         <br><br>
         I have created social media platform for foodies, an interactive
         application for children to learn about seasons and a web and mobile
         platform for Arabic speaking immigrants to practice for their VICroad
         knowledge test in their own language and receive feedback.

          The Driver ED website was a part of my Capstone Project design and
          delivery unit at Deakin University. It was created for our client at
          Whittlesea Community. In the project, our team created responsive
          website and mobile application.<br><br>I was responsible for designing
           the UI/UX design using Adobe XD followed by the responsive front-end
           development for the website using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. The
           website features feedback mode and practice mode quiz options which
           displays the VicRoads knowledge test questions and corresponding
           images from the SQL database. The language selection and display are
           implemented through JavaScript. Our team worked together to put the
           front-end and back-end together.

            The Arabic Driver Learner App
             was a part of my Capstone Project delivery unit at Deakin University.
             It was created for our client at Whittlesea Community.
            In the project, our team created web and mobile applications. <br><br>
            I created the Android mobile application using Android Studio. The Android
            application  is an offline application featuring feedback mode and
            practice mode quiz options which displays the VICroads knowledge test
            questions and corresponding images from the local JSON file. On
            completion of the quiz, the user can view correct answers as well
            as the quiz score. The app also has features such as sliding side menu
              navigation, home page, about us page and contact us page. One of the
            main features of this app is the language translate option, which allows
            the users to translate the whole app to arabic. At the current stage,
            the app only has Arabic and English language options but the feature
             can be extended to cater more languages.

          The Chef is a social media platform which allows users to share photos
          , ingredients and methods of their recipe. The users of the app can
          engage with each other through following or messaging each other to
          get inspired by the recipe and try creating it themselves. The real
          chef is simple and enjoyable way of sharing and marketing businesses
          too.<br><br>The Chef features user authentication, email verification,
           user search implemented through Firebase database.

          The Seasons is an interactive learning app for teachers and parents to
           help teach children about the four different seasons of the year-
           Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter in an interactive way. The app
           focusses on teaching the audience about when the seasons occur, what
           is done during that season, lifestyle during that season, clothing,
           food, and events and celebrations we have during that particular
           season. Since seasons are taught in earlier stages of childhood
           learning, by using this app, the children will understand about
           seasons in an interactive way.<br><br>
           The app uses firebase for user authentication, register and login
           functionality. The audios in the app are saved in the local data
           whereas the videos are retrieved from YouTube.
